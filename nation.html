Can we call it madness<br>
When democracy turn to crazyness<br>
This nation suffer a great disaster<br><br>

Can we call it madness<br>
When butcher child still feed on bone<br>
This nation is under suffering and smiling<br><br>

What else<br>
When the meat of this nation <br>
Is in the political soup of our leader<br>
Then how can the mass<br>
Enjoy the fat of this land<br><br>

What else <br>
When the landlords of this nation<br>
Swim in the pool of corruption<br>
And dancing with the tune of corruption<br>
I wish you are here Author<br>
To see it yourself<br><br>

Then<br>
What is the fate of the tenents in this nation<br>
When baron are now moron<br>
In those days litre of pectroleum is fifty naira<br>
Now is seven hundred naira<br>
This is madness<br><br>

If it is not crazyness<br>
Why do we have to travel <br>
Millions if miles<br>
To iron our cloth and get our phone charge<br><br>

If it is not madness <br<>
Why do will have to trek from one village to get kerosine and pectroleum<br>
Are we going to fold our arms?<br>
And continue suffering in the hands <br>
Of the present Gladiator<br><br>

When they sake the power of thination<br>
They made promises under oath<br>
Even many ghost woke to partook in their manifestoes<br>
Promising to abide by the constitution of the land<br><br>

Now<br>
Constitution as their attribution<br>
The roof of this nation is leaking<br>
Our landlords are there doing nothing<br>
Nothing but for nothing<br><br>

This nation<br>
Call for repainting<br>
Call for rebranding<br>
Tell the corrupt politician<br>
To be aware of the comming sinister<br>
Hope we will not suffer like this<br>
In the hand of the next Gladiator.<br>
