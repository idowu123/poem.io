          <center>Addicted<br> By Solomon Idowu Michael </center>
        </h1><br>
       <p><center>Am addicted to "....."<br>
        My blood is stain with foolishness<br>
        Lust is so sweet with love of evil<br>
        My lips so embraces  her kiss <br>
        A disaster in my blood<br>
        Address me if am wrong<br>
        Before it too late<br>
        Find it so difficult to go back<br>
        Desire of evil in my heart<br>
        Though my life is on the train track<br>
        Call me back if am going down the subway<br>
        Leading to the underway<br>
        I have miss my way<br>
        Evil call me on that faithfull day<br>
        I saw myself going astray<br>
        In the outskirt of life rectitude<br>
        Passion for the things of the world<br>
        This music is so high i cant hear the whistle of the good shepherd <br>
        Am i going to lost on this journey <br>
        In this journey of vanity<br>
        I try to drew my leg from this <br>
        Life drew me back to dark world<br>
        I heard the footstep of the priest<br>
        Running  after my footprint calling my name <br>
        Here and there everyday telling me to come back <br>
        Saying the wages of sin is dealth<br>
        Telling me that my lord is waiting for me where i left Him <br>
        I heard him but i had gone too far <br>
        When i was with in him in one body and soul<br>
        I promise him i will be faithful and take hid to righteous thing<br>
        Why so hard for me to go out of this<br>
        Tell the priest that my heart is so rigid<br>
        my heart is so adamant <br>
        A cobweb thread woven my heart <br>
        Tell my lord that i am a sinner<br>
        On a wrong path i found my foot<br>
        In a wreckage of addicted passion <br>
        In a commotion with devils sailors<br>
        On the sea of foolish emotions<br>
        Making fool of my life<br>
        Where i found my love in lust<br>
        Our life is like an onion<br>
        No one know the evil in man heart<br>
        Until our attitude divulge the secret in our life<br>
        When our life is bare naked <br>
        When enemy deride our life <br>
        Here and there<br>
        We love to do what we hate most<br>
        It a venom a pioson of addiction <br>
        it is a pain and sweet moment <br>
        Only the poet know the meaning of its poem<br>
        Address me if i have lost<br>
        Call me back before the trumpet sound<br>
        Before the day of judgment by my lord</center><br>
