    <p> <center>   
The day we call you<br>
To this earth<br>
We heard the rainbow scream<br>
Across the face of beautiful earth<br>
Men and women drinking wine<br>
Young men drinking alomo<br>
The beautiful day we can never forget<br>
..........................................<br>
You grow like bamboo tree<br>
Putting our eyes on you<br>
As a firstlin<br>
We knew you won't dissapoint us<br>
You won many trophies<br>
Who else don't know you<br>
As an athlete of the field<br>
But suddenly<br>
Field as your burial ground<br>
As you crept into the dark world<br>
..........................<br>
Now you put tears on our eye<br>
A pity on us <br>
We lost a great finger<br>
Seeing your cadevre<br>
Where you are laid<br>
Now you are restless and speechless<br>
You can't say I will!<br>
Though,you are a great athlete<br>
I saw all what you won<br>
Tears once again,tears once again<br>
The only bamboo tree<br>
In the forest<br>
Go to where people <br>
Go and never return<br>
