We are here again!!!<br>
The children of the street apartheid<br>
We are, that children<br>
Whose slept under the <br>
Subway path and bridges<br>
We are the one hustling <br>
In the street of Lagos<br>
We are here ramble the whole of Abuja<br>
We are the one you call slave<br>
We are the one whom <br>
You pray for everyday<br>
We are the one who is in need <br>
Of wardrobe allowance<br><br>

We are the son of that tax collector<br>
Whom you accused of <br>
Stealing your money<br>
We are the clan of whom you never <br>
Hear his name before<br>
We are the son of that <br>
Sole mender<br>
Hunter<br>
Farmer<br>
Sweeper<br>
Beggar<br>
Archer<br>
Maid <br>
Slave<br>
Whom you maltreat and cause<br>
And deride in the street everyday<br><br>
 
We are the children who <br>
Have no place to sleep<br>
We are children who lack three square meal a day<br>
We are not born with silver spoon<br>
We are the children of <br>
That poor old grey<br>
Hair woman in old 33 church yard Road<br>
We are the one whom <br>
You denial of bone<br>
From your fatty meat<br><br>

We are children that doesnt fear tiger<br>
We are children chanting your name<br>
Whenever you pass<br>
But you do spread dust on our eye<br>
With the first locomotive <br>
Speed of your car<br>
We are children screaming your name<br>
We wonder why you never <br>
Heard our voices<br>
When will you listen to us?<br>
When will you stop fighting? <br>
Over sit in house of assemble <br>
And listen to our grumble and rumble<br><br>

When will you remember us?<br>
We are children whom<br>
Father work in your ban<br>
We are that little children <br>
With bright future<br>
When are we going to enjoy <br>
That fat of our Father land <br>
Whom serve his fore father land?<br>
In pain and patriot<br><br>

Stop fighting over sit<br>
And remember the poor children<br>
We are the future of this our father fore-father land.<br>
We are tomorrow leader <br><br><br></center>
